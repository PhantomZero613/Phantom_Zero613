# AI Coding Agent Instructions for Phantom_Zero613

## Project Overview
This repository (`Phantom_Zero613`) is currently in its initial setup phase with only a basic README.md file. As the project develops, this document will be updated to reflect the evolving architecture, workflows, and conventions.

## Current State
- **Minimal Codebase**: Only `README.md` exists, containing the project title.
- **No Established Structure**: No source code, build scripts, tests, or dependencies have been added yet.
- **No Existing Conventions**: No prior AI instruction files (e.g., `.cursorrules`, `AGENT.md`) were found in the workspace.

## Development Guidelines (To Be Updated)
When code and structure are added to this project:
- Document the overall architecture, including major components and data flows.
- Include specific build, test, and debug commands that aren't obvious from file inspection.
- Note project-specific conventions, patterns, and integration points.
- Reference key files or directories that exemplify important approaches.

## Placeholder for Future Content
- **Architecture**: [To be added as components are developed]
- **Workflows**: [Build/test commands, debugging tips]
- **Patterns**: [Code style, naming conventions, etc.]
- **Dependencies**: [External services, libraries]

This file will be iteratively updated as the project grows. Focus on discoverable, project-specific knowledge to help AI agents contribute effectively.
